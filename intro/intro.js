// JS is the world most popular programming language.
// JS is the programming language for the web.

//JS can do the following
// 1. JS can change HTML content
// 2. JS can change HTML attribute values
// 3. JS can change HTML styles (CSS)
// 4. JS can hide HTML elements
// 5. JS can show HTML elements

// In HTML JS code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags
// NO need for type attribute
// Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.
function myFunction() {
  var x = 10;
  var y = 20;
  var z = (x + y) ** 2;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = z;
  console.log("Done");
  //console.log("one" + " two");
  //alert("hello");
}

//document.write(3 + 5);

//OUTPUT with JS
//JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

//Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
//Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
//Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
//Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
